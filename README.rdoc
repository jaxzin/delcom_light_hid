= Ruby driver for the Delcom USB HID Visual Signal Indicator RGY (904008, generation II)

Provides a simple interface to turn on/off the red, green and yellow LEDs.

It should be pretty trivial to adapt this driver to work with any generation II
signal indicator, however I only have access to the RGY version.

== Requirements

* ruby-usb: http://www.a-k-r.org/ruby-usb

== Example

See the bottom of +delcom_904008.rb+.
